<p>Today, I read <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/43380529?view_full_work=true"><em>The Right Tools For The Job</em></a> by freshlybakedspiderbread, and its manages to be quite in-character in its characterization of Kogasa, Raiko, and Sakuya, but still manages to be one of the most funniest pieces of Touhou fanfiction I ever read. It made me consider that Touhou fanworks in today’s era have evolved a unique language when compared to past fanworks.</p>

<p>I used to read all the Touhou doujinshi I could find, going on a <a href="https://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/thelist/">reading journey</a> that started on doujinshi released on <a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/doujins/touhou_project">Dynasty Reader</a> from the period of 2019 to January 30, 2006, when the <a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/its_not_a_dream">first scanlated Touhou doujinshi</a> was released on the internet. The journey was completed on June 27, 2023, and is now saved as a highlighted doujinshi list on Tachiyomi.</p>

<p>In reflection of my reading journey, most doujinshi from the mid-2000s don’t hold up to today’s standards on Touhou fanworks. These doujinshi employ <a href="https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/org-16699">Outside World jokes</a>, play on <a href="https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/org-371808">shallow characterization</a>, or have an imbalance on Touhou to parody. These doujinshi don’t feel very “Touhou” as its unique setting is ignored to serve as a stepping stone for comedy or parodies, instead of writing with the Touhou setting in mind.</p>

<p>This is not to say that there were no mid-2000s doujinshi that don’t write with the setting of Touhou, though I can only think of <a href="https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/md-8c4423d2-e676-4ff7-8a46-b5e00970d8cb">Two by This Side, Three by the Other Side</a>* by Personal Color for its exploration on the relationship with Yuyuko and Yukari. Still, it is clear that Touhou fans back in the day treated Touhou as a recreational activity which I cannot blame given the transcendent setting that ZUN would of left if he stopped at Phantasmagoria of Flower View. But that didn’t happen as the popularity of Touhou encouraged ZUN to create more Touhou works.</p>

<p>And this is what I have noticed during my reading journey that Touhou grows a more mature setting as ZUN wrote more youkai, system, and worlds into Touhou. I started to see more doujinshi written with more thematic meaning,  with prime exemplars being <a href="https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/org-303532"><em>Suzu and the Little Bird</em></a>, <a href="https://scarlet.nsk.sh/book/org-305719"><em>Jukai no Ito</em></a>, <a href="https://scarlet.nsk.sh/?q=artist:fantasy_engineering_works">Fantasy Engineering Works</a>, and <a href="https://scarlet.nsk.sh/?q=artist:zounose">Zounose</a>. Each of these doujinshi engrosses within the setting of Touhou by playing with the additional elements ZUN added to Touhou.</p>

<p>To come back to <em>The Right Tools For The Job</em> I can point to the fact that all humor within the story is very in-character for the Touhou characters used. Of course, Sakuya would go on a tangent about preparing human dishes while everyone around gives her odd looks. It shouldn’t be unexpected Raiko would play the role of professional drummer even in the most perilous situations. If I such a work was written in the mid-2000s, I would expect the jokes to be imported from other outside sources instead of being organically created by the Touhou characters themselves.</p>

<p>Nowadays, while the Touhou community still laughs at <em>Cirno’s Perfect Math Class</em> and Fumos, I say the community has moved away from import to creation. Truly, it is amazing that Touhou has evolved to be more than a drunk man’s idea.</p>

<p>Now dear reader, regardless if you are a Touhou fan or not, I recommend the following Touhou fanworks to anyone:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/43380529?view_full_work=true">The Right Tools For The Job</a></em>, - for giving me the spark to write this piece for its excellent in-character writing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://crescentia.bandcamp.com/album/suite-ad-astra"><em>suite ad astra</em></a> - for the bringing an array of moods as I wrote this by being a wonderful orchestral album.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/eol6d1/i_just_finished_typesetting_my_favorite_doujin/"><em>Moon River</em></a> - for referencing a song that one might find for <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX7nsZn9k8Q"><em>Stroke of Fake</em></a> - as one of the few Touhou Ska albums out there.</li>
