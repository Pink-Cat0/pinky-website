			<h2>Music</h2>
			<ul>
				<p>
					There are two sides to music. I prefer to listen to soft music when I am working, thinking, or when I want to take a break. Such music could be of environmental music such as The Riverlands, the album Exit Plan, or Library Stroll where I am able to let myself flow though my mind.
					Genres of easy listening music like bossa nova, lounge, and city pop are also part of my playlist; they are of what I feel personally as music for traveling. Examples include Give up on it,  starlight, and Magic Way.
					I also give special attention to folk and chiptune music as a niche genre that is diverse in their works. The works of Ringing Volcano never fail to impress me with how cute, yet evocative, their instruments play.
					FearofDark always is a solid artist when it comes to chiptune.
