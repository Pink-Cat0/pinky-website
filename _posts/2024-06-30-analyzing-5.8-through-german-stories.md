Spoiler Warning for 5.8

[5.8 is a unique Touhou CYOA on THP]() as everything within the story was a mystery to its readers. As such, it is best to read 5.8 blindly, especially if one wants to thinks about the choices as they come up with the story. 



Someone once decribed Yuuka as Alraune. Given canon, it could be described as a superficial comparsion with both being creatures of earth that are known to be sadastic women. Of course, that only applies with fanon Yuuka and not flower youkai Yuuka.

But then I considered Alriune from Project Moon and this interpretation of Alraune focuses on the  theme of unwanted resuscitation. This is described to the viewer as flowers that are in bloom regardless of the enviroment around.

In 5.8 there is the mystery of what Yuuka, Elly, and Schütz, spefically with the issues that Schütz is fated to be doomed.

Elly is described to a death god in reference to Ankou.
